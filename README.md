# Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++

This project is a simple yet complete implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** using C++. It demonstrates fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and traversal, which are key to understanding data structures and algorithms.

## 🧠 Features

- Insert a node
- Delete a node
- Search for a value
- Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals
- Display the BST structure

## 📁 Files

- `bst.cpp` – Main file containing the implementation and a simple CLI menu.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (like g++, clang, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of terminal/command prompt

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshushr/Binary-search-tree.git
   cd Binary-search-tree
