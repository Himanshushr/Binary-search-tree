# Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++

This project is a simple yet complete implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** using C++. It demonstrates fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and traversal, which are key to understanding data structures and algorithms.

## 🧠 Features

- Insert a node
- Delete a node
- Search for a value
- Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals
- Display the BST structure

## 📁 Files

- `bst.cpp` – Main file containing the implementation and a simple CLI menu.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (like g++, clang, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of terminal/command prompt

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshushr/Binary-search-tree.git
   cd Binary-search-tree
2. Compile the code:
g++ bst.cpp -o bst

3. Run the program:
   ./bst
4. Use the menu option to interact:
   1. Insert
   2. Delete
   3. Search
   4. Inorder Traversal
   5. Preorder Traversal
   6. Postorder Traversal
   7. Exit

5. Example: Enter your choice: 1
Enter value to insert: 50

Enter your choice: 1
Enter value to insert: 30

Enter your choice: 1
Enter value to insert: 70

Enter your choice: 4
Inorder traversal: 30 50 70

📚 Concepts Used
Binary Search Tree properties

Recursive functions

Tree traversal algorithms

Dynamic memory allocation

🎯 Why This Project?
Understanding the binary search tree is essential for:

Competitive programming

Technical interviews

Foundations of more advanced data structures (e.g., AVL, Red-Black trees)

🔧 Possible Improvements
Add AVL Tree (self-balancing BST)

Implement graphical visualization

Write unit tests

Add a GUI using C++ Qt or Python (via socket/bridge)
